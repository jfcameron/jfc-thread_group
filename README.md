## jfc-thread_group

Task-based concurrency lib. Threadgroup that wraps the "moody concurrent queue" lockless queue

### unique_handle
Unique Handle models the single owner case with move support to another unique handle or a shared handle. 

### shared_handle
Shared handle models the many owners case, the deletor is invoked when the final owner falls out of scope. A shared handle can also be copied to a Weak Handle. 

### weak_handle
Weak handle is similar to Shared, except it does not contribute to the use_count and the handle cannot be accessed directly. Instead, the lock method must be called, which returns an optional to a shared handle. If the handle that the weak handle is observing has not fallen out of scope at the time of the lock then the optional will contain a new shared handle to the resource. If not, then the optional will be null.
